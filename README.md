## A slice of life based on real facts

A story about a person called Imane, born a woman, but identifying as a non-binary. They live in a country where the LGBT community, among other minorities, is oppressed. They can be jailed for assuming who they are. They share a slice of their life with us. They wake up, and check Telegram, an end-to-end communication application. Even the government cannot decrypt their messages if it catch them. They got messages that one of their friends got caught by police. They hope that he will be released soon. But right now, they have to shower. They play music thanks to the secured streaming music application Spotify. Indeed, even their music is satanic according to their government, they have to take care. After cleaning, Imane goes on their computer for their blog about their life. This computer is encrypted and runs on PureOS. They have thousands of followers around the world. Before connecting to Internet, Imane first connects to Tor, and a VPN. Both are used to encapsulate and protect their privacy on Internet: it is extremly hard to know the content of the packets, the location, the origin and the destination. Without that, they may be caught. Their phone vibrate: they received a message on Whatsapp, an other secured communication application. This one is blocked in many countries, but not in their, fortunately. Imane also check theirs emails thanks to Protonmail.
